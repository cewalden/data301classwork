    "* Your dataset needs to be sufficiently large and complex to explore interesting questions:\n",
    "  - Tabular data\n",
    "    - Should have enough columns in one or more tables to answer interesting questions. In practice, one table with many columns or multiple tables will be required.\n",
    "    - After you have grouped by all categorical columns, the resulting groups should have at least 100s of rows.\n",
    "    - Should have numerous columns with different data types (categorical, geographical, date/time, quantitative).\n",

    "To get credit for the project, you **must** present your project to the class during the official final time for the class. You will use the notebook to do your presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your presentation should be a narative that describes your data science process, and the questions you explored.\n",
    "* You should do live demonstrations and a summary of the code, but you shouldn't get too technical about the details of the code.\n",
    "* Remember, most of the class won't know anything about the dataset, topics or questions you are presenting about.\n",
    "* If you have code that takes a while to run, you should run the code before the presentation, save the results to a file, load the results from disk and perform final analysis and visualizations.\n",
    "* Your presentation notebook should be a separate notebook from the main notebook that contains the full data science process and its description.\n",
    "* You will have 5-7 minutes total for your presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Students and faculty outside the class will be invited to attend the final presentations.**"

    "You will be graded on the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code is well organized into relatively small functions (10-20 lines) that do one thing.\n",
    "* Functions have docstrings describing what they do.\n",
    "* Appropriate variable and function names are used.\n",
    "* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is approximately followed for code style.\n",
    "* Code that is used in multiple notebooks is put into standalone `.py` files and imported.\n",
    "* Code is written with fast performance in mind and does not have any significant performance problems.\n",
    "* All of your notebooks should run from scratch in a reasonable amount of time. Please make a note about code that takes a long (more than a few minutes) to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Narrative\n",
    "\n",
    "* Narrative text in the form of Markdown cells is provided to describe the dataset, code, results, visualizations, modeling, etc.\n",
    "* When appropriate, equations are included (LaTeX).\n",
    "* You identify the core questions you will study.\n",
    "* The narrative tells a compelling *story* that motivates and answers the questions.\n",
    "* A one paragraph abstract is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "* The project is organized into multiple notebooks with clear titles and ordering. Something like this:\n",
    "  - `01-Introduction.ipynb`\n",
    "  - `02-Import.ipynb`\n",
    "  - `03-Tidy.ipynb`\n",
    "  - `03-EDA.ipynb`\n",
    "  - `04-Modeling.ipynb`\n",
    "  - `06-Presentation.ipynb`\n",
    "* An introduction notebook is provided with the following sections:\n",
    "  - Abstract\n",
    "  - Description of the dataset.\n",
    "  - Index of other notebooks with a short description\n",
    "  - Citations\n",
    "* Each notebook has well organized Markdown sections with headings.\n",
    "* More details of the notebook format and organization will be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import and Tidy\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple tidy tables are used to encode one-one, one-many and many-many relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data exploration is tied to the questions you are exploring and this relationship is made explicit.\n",
    "* Visualizations adhere to the theory and practice of effective visualizations.\n",
    "* Interesting relationships in different parts of the dataset are explored.\n",
    "* Interactive widgets are used to explore the dataset interactively.\n",
    "* Appropriate visualizations are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bootstrap resampling is used to create distributions and confidence intervals of any estimated statistics.\n",
    "* Appropriate statistical models (regression, maximum likelihood, classification) are built to explore relationships, extract insight from the data and make predictions.\n",
    "* Best practices of machine learning (test/train splitting, cross validation, hyper-parameter optimization, error analysis, etc.)\n",
    "* Multiple algorithms/models are compared where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge area\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your project should contain at least one challenge area that involves your learning a new Python library, statistical technique, etc.\n",
    "* Examples\n",
    "  - A new data storage format, such as HDF5.\n",
    "  - A dataset involving time series and date/times (such as financial assets over time)."
